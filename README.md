# Brain Training Platform

A comprehensive cognitive enhancement platform featuring scientifically-designed exercises to improve various aspects of cognitive function.

## Exercises

### RRT (Reasonal Relational Training)
Enhances logical reasoning and cognitive flexibility through premise-based exercises.

**Cognitive Benefits:**
- Abstract reasoning
- Logical deduction
- Pattern recognition
- Cognitive flexibility
- Working memory

**Exercise Modes:**
- Temporal Relations (understanding before/after relationships)
- Distinction (same/different relationships)
- 2D Spatial Relations
- 3D Spatial Relations
- Syllogistic Reasoning
- Analogical Thinking

### 3D MOT (Multiple Object Tracking)
Improves visual-spatial attention and working memory through dynamic 3D object tracking.

**Cognitive Benefits:**
- Visual attention
- Spatial awareness
- Working memory
- Divided attention
- Processing speed
- Peripheral vision

**Features:**
- Adjustable number of targets
- Variable movement speed
- Collision physics
- Customizable tracking duration
- Performance tracking

### N-Back
Strengthens working memory through multi-modal stimulus matching.

**Cognitive Benefits:**
- Working memory
- Fluid intelligence
- Pattern recognition
- Multi-tasking ability
- Attention control

**Features:**
- 2D and 3D grid options
- Multiple stimulus types:
  - Position
  - Color
  - Audio
  - Shape
  - Number
- Adjustable difficulty (N-level)
- Performance metrics for each stimulus type

### UFOV (Useful Field of View) - Coming Soon
Will enhance visual processing speed and peripheral awareness.

**Planned Benefits:**
- Visual processing speed
- Divided attention
- Selective attention
- Peripheral vision
- Cognitive processing speed

## Scientific Background

Each exercise in this platform is based on established cognitive training research:

- **RRT:** Based on relational frame theory and studies showing improved reasoning abilities through structured logical training.

- **3D MOT:** Inspired by research with professional athletes showing enhanced visual-spatial awareness and decision-making speed.

- **N-Back:** Supported by studies demonstrating improvements in fluid intelligence and working memory capacity.

- **UFOV:** Based on research showing significant improvements in driving safety and everyday visual attention tasks.
